Biboo's here to play
(Yeah, uh huh, ah ah)
Let's go
Woke up in the morning
I had a funny dream
I was a stone that had been thrown
No way back, I was all in (I was all in)
What if that was me soaring straight to the top?
Let's take a chance, game on and shoot my shot
Log in, get good, you mad? Let's cook
Talk beep, get hit, clean sweep, let's go
Now you know what's up
Hit 'em with a one-two-three, BIBOO BIBOO
Come and test your luck
Yeah we comin' in clutch, BIBOO BIBOO
Skipping stone in flight
Take 'em out one-shot, BIBOO BIBOO
Come and help me fight
Get on up, let's go, just me and you
Player one and player two
We'll see this through
Close my eyes, make a wish
One more shot, I will not miss
ROCK IN!
Bububa Bububu Ba

Bububa Bumbum Ba
Bububa Bubu Yeah
Bububa Baba Ba
Bububu Bububu Bububu Ba
Level up, we go onwards
Aiming for another win
A diamond in the rough, it's kinda tough
You gotta keep on rollin' (Gotta keep on
rollin')
The grind goes on and on, no breaks
Seal the cracks with a few bandaids
I'll try over and over and over again
Just one more round, please?
Now you know what's up
Hit 'em with a one-two-three, BIBOO BIBOO
Come and test your luck
Yeah we comin' in clutch, BIBOO BIBOO
Skipping stone in flight
Take 'em out one-shot, BIBOO BIBOO
Come and help me fight
Get on up, let's go, just me and you
Player one and player two
We'll see this through
Close my eyes, make a wish
One more shot, I will not miss
ROCK IN!
Lost in this game, I feel the strain
But I'm pulled back up by your gravity
Your gravity
I see the shape, I feel the space
It's set in stone, carve it into me
I just wanna be Biboo
Now you know what's up
Hit 'em with a one-two-three, BIBOO BIBOO
Come and test your luck
Yeah we comin' in clutch, BIBOO BIBOO
Skipping stone in flight
Take 'em out one-shot, BIBOO BIBOO
Better hit quicksave 'cause
Biboo's here to play
Now you know what's up
Hit 'em with a one-two-three, BIBOO BIBOO
Come and test your luck
Yeah we comin' in clutch, BIBOO BIBOO
Skipping stone in flight
Take 'em out one-shot, BIBOO BIBOO
Come and help me fight
Get on up, let's go, just me and you
Player one and player two
We'll see this through
Close my eyes, make a wish
One more shot, I will not miss
ROCK IN!
Rock In!
BIBOO BIBOO!
